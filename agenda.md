## Red Hat OpenShift - Enterprise Kubernetes for Microsoft Azure
Containers have revolutionized the DevOps process, transforming how organizations build, ship, and run applications on any infrastructure.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is an enterprise container application platform based on industry standards, Docker, and Kubernetes. Combined with the power of the Microsoft Cloud via Azure, organizations can accelerate moving existing applications to the cloud, speed the time to market of new products, and deliver more innovation to customers.
In this workshop, Eric Webb, National Infrastructure Solution Manager at Cardinal Solutions, will discuss how containers solve many of the challenges for development and operations. See how you can start taking advantage of the cloud, without rewriting all of your existing applications. Eric will also demonstrate how Microsoft and Red Hat combined can improve speed, scalability, security, innovation, and cost for your IT organization.
