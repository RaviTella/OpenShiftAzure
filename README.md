# OpenShift Workshop Roadshow
The OpenShiftAzure project is an effort to provide a content toolkit and educational reference for effectively communicating and teaching Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.7 topics for customers testing or deploying on Azure

## What's Provided
The OpenShiftAzure project has been designed to be used as a toolkit and best practices reference for OpenShift presentations ranging from demos thru self-paced learning thru hands-on workshops. Here you will find:

* Examples
* Workshops
* Presentation Decks
* Lab Provisioner
* Facilitator Guide

### Assumed Knowledge
For hands-on or self-paced training, students should have working knowledge of using an Azure subscription, SSH and command line shell (BASH). The ability to SSH from their personal laptop to a lab environment hosted in Azure public cloud can also be required based on the format and presentation of the context.

For demos and instrcutor-led exercises, conceptual understanding of linux system admin, DevOps, microservices, VMs, and distributed application architecture is all that is required.
